##"run_analysis.R" 
A script that takes data from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone <https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip> and exports a neat and tidy summary of them in "tidy.txt". The script is commented in the "README.txt".
#The variables are:
- activities 
- subjects 
- the average of each variable for each activity and each subject of the means and standard deviations of the accelerometer data in time and frequency domain (81 variables) explained in the "features_info.txt" of the downloaded dataset.
